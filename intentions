---MY.INTENTIONS--
Having been in high school for the first time ever last year I have not yet experienced stress but having 3 older siblings which 2 have
finished and the other in her senior years i definitely know what stress looks like. One day I had this idea, what if I made a website 
that was aimed at students who had a lot of stress on them? That would make me probally the greatest person on earth, right? So that is
what I WILL do. It really depends if I can dedicate a majority of my teen life to a project and hopefully make it my job. So a young man 
sees a good opportunity and he takes it but he remembers, nothing in this world comes for free so he must work hard to make the risk he 
took worth it. Let me tell you, I promise to never ditch this project and kill off this hell that we call "stress" and I will do it with 
clothes on my back and the money I found on the sidewalk.
